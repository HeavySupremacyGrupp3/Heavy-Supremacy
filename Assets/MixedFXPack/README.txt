Import the "Particle Systems" package from the Unity standard assets.
Only the textures in the "textures" folder from that package should be required but to ensure
that everything will work as expected. Though if you want to skip the tinkering of what to import
and what not to import from the "particle systems" package you can import the whole thing.
